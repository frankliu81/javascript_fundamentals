// you define a variable in Javascript using 'variable'
// Javascript also uses duck typing
// you are able to define variable without var, but it is
// not advisable, it makes the variable global

//var name = prompt("What is your name?")
//alert("Hello " + name);

// run with node.js
var name = "Tam"
console.log("Hello " + name)
